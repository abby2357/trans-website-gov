        <li><h3>HB267</h3></li>
        <li><p>
            AL SB101 and AL HB267 are two similar pieces of legislation that would disallow anyone under the age of 18 to give legal consent to
            participate in certain medical procedures. Under this is included mental health services for themselves including school counseling. 
            It would require a parent's consent to receive access to mental health care and would also allow parents to request information on their 
            child's counseling. It would also allow parents to force their children under 18 to receive mental health counseling if they see fit. 
            This is alarming in multiple ways such that it takes away the freedom of a person to see to their own mental health and get themselves 
            counseling as they see fit. This would help prevent a lot of suicides and mental health related issues that youth, especially trans youth, 
            experience. It would also give way too much power to a parent to force their child into counseling, as conversion therapy is still allowed 
            in Alabama and could be forced upon a trans youth with repercussions as part of this bill.
        </p></li>
        <li><h3>HB246</h3></li>
        <li><p>
            AL HB246 is a bill that would prohibit employees of educational institutions from using names and pronouns that are inconsistent with a 
            student's legal name or sex without permission from their guardian.
        </p></li>
        <li><h3>HB244</h3></li>
        <li><p>
            AL HB244 would prohibit instruction and discussions including topics like gender identity and sexual orientation from being taught to students
            from kindergarten through 12th grade.
        </p></li>
        <li><h3>SB184</h3></li>
        <li><p>
            AL SB184 prohibits public health officials from administering life saving gender affirming health care to minors such as puberty blockers, 
            medications, and surgeries and constitutes it as a Class C felony. This bill was passed on April 7th, 2022 and is being fought against by 
            organizations like the ACLU. In the court case Walker et al v Marshall et al, two families with transgender children, being represented by 
            ACLU officials are arguing that prohibiting minors from accessing gender affirming care violates the Equal Protection Clause. In a case 
            from 2022, that is still ongoing, similar issues pertaining to a minor\u2019s right to receive gender affirming care were discussed. A family
            was investigated by a child welfare employee after their transgender teenager was allowed gender affirming care. In Doe v. Abbott, Governor 
            Greg Abbott is arguing that health care for trans youth constitutes as a form of child abuse and any child in this situation should be removed 
            from their family. In 2023, after 24 states banned hormone therapy for transgender youth, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected requests 
            from both families and medical providers to allow transgender youth to access gender affirming medical care. They asked SCOTUS to hear the case 
            listed as U.S. v. Skrmetti, which is still pending and which the decision of the Supreme Court will set a precedent for the examples listed above 
            and many more cases regarding trans youth access to health care. 
        </p></li>
        <li><h3>SB79</h3></li>
        <li><p>
            ALSB79, also part of the “What is a Woman?” Act, attempted to define gendered terms such as “boy”, “girl”, “father”, “mother”, and other 
            terms not related specifically to sex, by biological sex only. It also stated that public spaces can establish single-sex environments, 
            forcing people whose sex doesn't align with their gender identity to go into places like bathrooms based on their biological sex. US HB1016 
            is similar to this bill, stating that individuals cannot use single-sex facilities on Federal property other than those that align with their 
            biological sex.
        </p></li>

    <h2 id="exec-orders">Executive Orders</h2>
    <ul class="policy-list">
        <li><h3>Keep men out of women's sports</h3></li>
        <li><ul class="exec-order-sections">
            <li><h4>Description</h4></li>
            <li><p>
                The “Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports” is an executive order by President Trump that would ban transgender women from participating in 
                women's sports, effectively deeming them all-female sports, all-female locker rooms, etc. It promotes, including at the United Nations, 
                a sex-based sports separation. The argument for this is that transgender women have a biological step up and therefore it would be unfair 
                to place them in the same category as cisgender women. However, many transgender women and girls take things like puberty blockers and 
                hormone therapy that reduce their testosterone, meaning they are on a “level playing field”. Because of this, barring trans women from 
                sports should be considered unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. This executive order is targeted at trans women but it 
                also affects cisgender women as not all women are the same in terms of hormone levels, chromosomes, and other factors. If you were to base 
                participation in women's sports based off of any of these factors, solely to discriminate against trans women, you would also be discriminating 
                against cisgender women. A study by the National Library of Medicine found that transgender athletes, post-transition, performed on par with 
                their cisgender counterparts and thus there is no real disparity between trans and cis athletes that would support Trump's executive order.
            </p></li>
            <li><h4>Court Cases</h4></li>
            <li><p>
                Although Trump's order was only signed on February 5th, there has already been pushback against this with a lawsuit being filed against the 
                Trump administration. This was filed by two transgender high school students whose defense was that the order violated the Constitution and 
                Title IX, which is a civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education activities and programs including athletics. This 
                is not the only pushback against anti-trans legislation regarding sports. In 2024, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of trans 
                rights in the case Doe v. Horne. In this case two transgender girls, who were on puberty blockers, were barred from participating in their 
                schools girls sports teams. The court ruled  that the “biological driver of average group differences in athletic performance between adolescent 
                boys and girls is the difference in their respective levels of testosterone, which only begin to diverge significantly after the onset of 
                puberty.” and such, the girls did not have any advantage and were allowed to participate in the sports teams of their gender identity. 
                The argument in this case was that the equal protection clause and Title IX barred sex-discrimination which was occurring.
            </p></li>
            <li><h4>Effects</h4></li>
            <li><p>
                Anti trans sports laws negatively affect cis girls and trans girls by reminding them of a stereotype of men being better at sports. It also 
                subjects cis girls, who are often minors, to questions of their sex and gender and could possibly lead to inspections that would violate them. 
                It also sets a precedent for deciding what is the “requirement” for someone to be girl or woman enough to participate in women's sports because 
                many cisgender women do not align completely with some of these politicians' definitions of a woman, i.e. chromosomes, hormone levels, 
                reproductive organs.
            </p></li>
            <li><h4>Alabama Legislation</h4></li>
            <li><p>
                In multiple states including Alabama there are pieces of legislation that prohibits trans athletes from participating in sports based on their 
                gender identity. In May of 2023, Governor Kay Ivey signed a bill that bans transgender athletes at colleges and universities from participating 
                on the sports team of their gender identity. This bill, HB 261, forces public, higher education institutes to create sex-based sports categories.
            </p></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><h3>Ending radical indoctrination in k-12 schooling</h3></li>
        <li><ul class="exec-order-sections">
            <li><h4>Description</h4></li>
            <li><p>
                Trump's “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling” order would eliminate funding to “illegal and discriminatory treatment and 
                indoctrination in K-12 schools, including based on gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology” and allow law enforcement to file 
                action against K-12 teachers who violate the law by “unlawfully facilitating the social transition of a minor student”. Essentially, this 
                order would make it illegal for a teacher to use a student's preferred name and pronouns, make it illegal for transgender students to use 
                the bathroom of their gender identity, and prevent transgender youth from receiving psychological counseling among many other things. It 
                also incentivizes schools to cut out any mention of gender identity and sexual orientation from their curriculum as it could lead to a loss 
                of federal funding that is needed for schools to survive. This is yet another example of Trump's executive orders violating the Equal Protection 
                Clause by discriminating based on sex. Although there is no specific support for the right to an education in the Constitution, there are 
                amendments that help to provide this in other ways.The Equal Protection Clause as well as the Due Process Clause prohibit states from denying 
                life, liberty, and property based on sex discrimination. Although there is no specific support for the right to an education in the Constitution, 
                there are amendments that help to provide this in other ways. The First Amendment right of free speech could also be applied here, stating that 
                Trump's attempt to block “gender ideology” discussions in classrooms is an attempt to limit free speech. The AHA, American Historical 
                Association, has put out a statement on this executive order, saying that this attempt to “grossly mischaracterize history education” is 
                subversive and harmful to any student's education.     
            </p></li>
            <li><h4>Court Cases</h4></li>
            <li><p>
                In a landmark case for trans rights, Doe v Clenchy involved a transgender girl in Maine who was denied access to use the bathroom of her 
                gender identity. She and her family filed a complaint with the Maine Human Rights Commission and filed a complaint that eventually went to 
                Maine's highest court where it was ruled that a denial of the right to use the bathroom based on the girl's gender identity violated her 
                rights under the state's Human Rights Act. In another case, a lawsuit was made against a public school district in Wisconsin because of a 
                policy that would allow students to go by their preferred name and pronouns which supposedly opposed some parents' religious rights. 
                They argued that the Equal Protection Clause was supposed to support their right to equality no matter their religion and allowing students 
                to go against their religion by using preferred name and pronouns was a violation of that right. The Supreme Court heard this case in 2022 
                and dismissed after finding out that neither of the challengers received or experienced legal injury themselves. In the case of Mahmoud v. 
                Taylor, parents of religious backgrounds attempted to sue the school board of Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland for approving 
                LGBTQ inclusive books that went against their religion. The district court denied their motion, saying that their religious freedom was 
                not infringed upon, however the case is still being decided.
            <li><h4>Effects</h4></li>
            <li><p>
                Not allowing students access to topics that include LGBTQ related themes is depriving them of a much needed education. It will seriously 
                inhibit students if all topics that include gender and sexual orientation were to be banned from being discussed.
            </p></li>
            <li><h4>Alabama Legislation</h4></li>
            <li><p>
                In Alabama, HB 130 limits teachers' address of sexual orientation and gender identity from kindergarten to twelfth grade. Pride flags and 
                other memorabilia including insignias associated with LGBTQ groups would be banned. This is all part of Alabama's “Don't Say Gay Bill”. 
                The use of preferred pronouns and names is also being discussed and moving forward to be banned. As multiple people have stated, these bills 
                will not only affect LGBTQ discussions but other topics as well.
            </p></li>

        <li><h3>Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation</h3></li>
        <li><ul class="exec-order-sections">
            <li><h4>Description</h4></li>
            <li><p>
                This executive order asserts that medical professionals are harming children by allowing minors to access gender affirming care and that 
                anyone under the age of 19 cannot consent to these practices. It also states that any funding that would promote or assist in these 
                practices will be cut including Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act. In 26 states, gender affirming healthcare is already 
                banned for those under 18 and in some it is a felony for medical professionals to provide that care to minors. Once again, the Equal 
                Protection Clause is the main argument that sex based discrimination is occuring when healthcare is not provided specifically to transgender 
                individuals. Gender-affirming care is not limited to irreversible operations like surgery, but also completely reversible ones like puberty 
                blockers and hormone therapy. By banning these practices, there is a violation of equal protection for everyone. Many studies including one 
                by the HHS Office of Population Affairs show that youth access to gender-affirming services are necessary and life changing. Access to this 
                health care would save the lives of many transgender youth and would foster a better environment and outcome for so many transgender people.
                The American Psychological Association has also approved a statement that supports healthcare access cor transgender people including children.
            </p></li>
            <li><h4>Court Cases</h4></li>
            <li><p>
                In U.S. v. Skrmetti the plaintiffs argue that Tennessee Senate Bill 1 violates the Equal Protection Clause. They argue that prohibiting minors 
                from receiving gender-affirming care does not protect them from any physical or emotional risk and instead opens them up to more. This case is 
                still ongoing and pending decisions, yet its outcome will have an effect and set a precedent that will shape many more cases like this to come. 
                It could limit not only gender-affirming care but also things like birth control.
            </p></li>
            <li><h4>Effects</h4></li>
            <li><p>
                Not allowing minors access to life saving gender-affirming care will cause horrible amounts of damage to transgender youth. Many experts have 
                stated that gender-affirming care is necessary to transgender people and that by allowing minors to start their transition early, negative 
                effects can be minimized. 
            </p></li>
            <li><h4>Alabama Legislation</h4></li>
            <li><p>
                In Alabama it is not only illegal for people under 19 to receive gender-affirming care but it is also a felony to practice this care. In 2023, 
                the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals allowed Alabma to enforce the ban of puberty blockers and hormone therapy for those under 19.
            </p></li>

        <li><h3>Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness</h3></li>
        <li><ul class="exec-order-sections">
            <li><h4>Description</h4></li>
            <li><p>
                Trump's “Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness” order attempts to ban transgender people from joining the military under the basis 
                of the identity of a trans person being a mental illness that would inhibit them from participating and actively defending their country. 
                This is another clear violation of the Equal Protection Clause because of its blatant sex discrimination. Disallowing transgender people 
                to participate in the army is completely unconstitutional and not only negatively affects trans people but also the US army itself.
            </p></li>
            <li><h4>Court Cases</h4></li>
            <li><p>
                One of the first cases regarding trans people in the military was in the 1970s, the case of Mary Elizabeth Clark who served as a United States 
                Navy chief petty officer before being discharged after her past was discovered by higher-ups. She was able to bring the suit against the Army 
                and win a $25,000 settlement. More recent cases have also been important in the discussion of trans people in service. In 2018 a federal judge 
                in Seattle ruled that transgender people should be allowed to serve in the military and that any attempt to exclude them would be discrimination 
                based on sex and gender. Following Trump's executive order many federal district courts blocked the military ban of trans individuals.
            </p></li>
            <li><h4>Effects</h4></li>
            <li><p>
                Prohibiting transgender people from joining the army and so blatantly discriminating like this opens the floor to so much more discrimination 
                and violation of rights of not only trans people but other minorities as well.

                We have already seen this, not implemented but having an effect as recently the letter “T” was removed from federal government websites, 
                on president Trump's orders as well as from the Stonewall National Monument. This completely erases the work and dedication of many of the

        By messaging your representatives, you can let them know that you want them to fight against these transphobic bills and orders. By choosing to speak out,
        you make your voice heard and can help protect the rights of trans people and other minorities.

        Click here to message your representatives in Alabama
    </a>
    <p>The link contains a pre-written message to send to your legislature, letting them know to vote NO on HB267, the message reads as follows:</p>
    <p>"Members of the House Health Committee, I am calling on you to vote NO on HB267. This bill clearly violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th 
        Amendment and will cause irreparable damage to many of Alabama's youth if allowed to pass. The bill would not only prohibit those under the age of 
        18 from receiving healthcare that could possibly save their lives, but also allow parents to force their children into receiving mental health services 
        that they do not wish to receive. Currently, anyone over the age of 14 can consent to receiving mental health services including school counseling, 
        which is a perfectly reasonable age to have the responsibility of consenting to your own mental health counseling.  This bill would allow for an 
        enormous amount of government overreach, as no government official should be saying whether parents can force their child into unwanted mental 
        healthcare. This would open up another issue where youth who are particularly vulnerable, specifically transgender youth, would be discriminated 
        against and prohibited from receiving life changing mental healthcare. This bill would cause a vast amount of damage to Alabama's youth and should 
        be stopped in any way possible. I urge you to vote NO on HB267."</p>
