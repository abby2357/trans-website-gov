    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        We're Abby and Jamie! We're two high schoolers who have created this webpage as part of a school project. We specifically chose to discuss trans
        legislation and healthcare because it is something that is important to us, and we feel that the rights of trans individuals are under attack
        by the Trump Administration. Despite how bleak things may look, we know that there are still people in congress who will fight for us, but
        we have to make sure they know what we want. So, we've listed a series of bills and executive orders for the United States and Alabama that 
        would hurt trans people, and have provided a template response to email your representative and tell them that we don't want more transphobia. <br><br>
        Thank you for taking the time to read
